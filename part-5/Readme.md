# Part 5: Placing enemies and kicking them

Nothing remarkable to write after part 5 completed other than I think the code is starting to get a bit messy. In trying to balance spending enough time working on the tutorial and learning zig and figuring out how to translate and solve problems to the Zig way I've let the overall structure get away from me. I think that's probably okay, I'll come back later on in the process and refactor once I get a bit more experience. I'll see how part 6 goes, it's a good bit longer than parts 4 or 5.

I'm also very slowly starting to build up some instinct for when there will be a memory leak and how to make sure I free memory when it's no longer needed.
